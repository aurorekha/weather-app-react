# React weather app

To start get the project started please follow the steps below.

- Checkout the repo
- type yarn
- yarn start
- yarn test (to run the tests)

# Tech stack used:

I used React, typescript, react hooks, axios, Material UI and for the tests I used jest and enzyme. For styles I used SCSS and mostly styled the components the Material UI way.

# Approach

I have started with create-react-app and for the general look and feel I have decided to try Material UI, though i barely used it before for some icons etc this was my first time trying to use it on the full project and I had a lot of fun doing so. Next, the descrption says it should have once button which should fire off two calls but the first call had more than one value so I added a link to each of the results which then makes a second call as that felt intuitive for me. I have written some tests for the components and calls.

# Possible improvements

As i went along i kept refactoring bits and bobs but there is still some more that can be refactored and done better, to name a few: - The table in the mobile view doesn't look like i want it. - I would have liked some icons on the weather description. - Add some more tests!!!

I also didn't have enough time to add a loading state. I have done this in a hurry
only to showcase my relevant skills but i know this can be widely improved upon.
